# Weather App - My Second React Project

This project is part of my ongoing effort to develop my frontend skills. It was made with React and Tailwind CSS. It is a follow-up to a tutorial on Youtube which I thought could use some improvements in code structure and functionality.

Have a look at the deployment and see important weather information from any city in the world!

## Challenges

- Using Tailwind CSS was quite a different experience from using normal CSS and I had to learn how to use inline styles using a different syntax

- More research had to be done to use new and different APIs

- More research had to be done to find other React Hooks that allowed functionalities to run only under certain conditions even with re-rendering

Overall, I found this project to be fun as I got to explore more aspects of React and API usage, as well as learning how to use Tailwind CSS!
